          <p>Drag the handle to adjust the minimum tree cover canopy (TCC) density for the visualization and analysis of UMD tree cover and tree cover loss. TCC density represents the estimated percent of a UMD pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, TCC density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover <u>before</u> loss occurred. For example, if you select 25% as the minimum TCC density, you will only see tree cover loss pixels for which the original tree cover density was greater than 25%.</p>
          <p>Adjustments to the minimum TCC density only affect UMD tree cover and tree cover loss data layers. This feature does not pertain to UMD tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or statistics. UMD tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%. The minimum TCC density cannot be changed independently for tree cover and tree cover loss. A change made to one data layer will immediately take effect in the other.</p>
          <p>This feature is also available for statistics within the country profiles and rankings. However, the adjustment made to the visualization and analysis through the map view will not be automatically reflected in other areas of the website. To adjust the minimum TCC density within the country and country rankings pages, click on the settings icon.</p>

              <p>This data layer was updated in January 2015 to extend the tree cover loss analysis to 2013. The 2013 data update included new Landsat 8 data (launched in February 2013) as well as re-processed 2010-2012 data from Landsat TM and ETM+, which increased the amount of change that could be detected, resulting in some changes in calculated tree cover loss for 2011 (global increase of 6%) and 2012 (increase of 22%). Calculated tree cover loss for 2001-2010 remains unchanged. The integrated use of the original 2001-2012 (Version 1.0) data and the updated 2011–2013 data (Version 1.1) should be performed with caution.</p>

              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height. “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations existing over a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree canopy cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation.</p>
              <p>When zoomed out (< zoom level 13), pixels of loss are shaded according to the density of loss at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover loss, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover loss. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 13).</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>This data set measures areas of tree cover loss across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at approximately 30 × 30 meter resolution. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a>, and <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a>, and <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat8.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 8</a> Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. Over 1 million satellite images were processed and analyzed, including over 600,000 Landsat 7 images for the 2000-2012 interval, and approximately 400,000 Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images for the 2010-2013 interval. The clear land surface observations in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss.</p>

          <p>Tree cover loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may be the result of human activities, including forestry practices such as timber harvesting or deforestation (the conversion of natural forest to other land uses), as well as natural causes such as disease or storm damage.  Fire is another widespread cause of tree cover loss, and can be either natural or human-induced.</p>
          <p><strong>2015 Update (Version 1.1)</strong></p>
          <p>This data set was recently updated and now includes a 2013 loss layer and revised layers for 2011 and 2012. The analysis method has been modified in numerous ways, and the update should be seen as part of a transition to a future “version 2.0” of this data set that is more consistent over the entire 2001 and onward period. Key changes include:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>The use of Landsat 8 data for 2013 and Landsat 5 data for 2010-2011</li>
            <li>The reprocessing of data from 2011 to 2012 in measuring loss</li>
            <li>Improved training data for calibrating the loss model</li>
            <li>Improved per sensor quality assessment models to filter input data</li>
            <li>Improved input spectral features for building and applying the loss model</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These changes lead to a different and improved detection of global tree cover loss. However, the years preceding 2011 have not yet been reprocessed with the revised analysis methods, and users will notice inconsistencies between versions 1.0 (2001-2012) and 1.1 (2001-2013) as a result. It must also be noted that a full validation of the results incorporating Landsat 8 has not been undertaken. Such an analysis may reveal a more sensitive ability to detect and map forest disturbance using Landsat 8 data. If this is the case then there will be a more fundamental limitation to the consistency of this data set before and after the inclusion of Landsat 8 data. Validation of Landsat 8-incorporated loss detection is planned.</p>
          <p>Some examples of improved change detection in the 2011–2013 update include the following:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Improved detection of boreal forest loss due to fire</li>
            <li>Improved detection of smallholder rotation agricultural clearing in dry and humid tropical forests</li>
            <li>Improved detection of selective logging</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are examples of dynamics that may be differentially mapped over the 2001-2013 period in Version 1.1. A version 2.0 reprocessing of the 2001 and onward record is planned, but no delivery date is yet confirmed.</p>

              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height. “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations existing over a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree canopy cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation.</p>

              <p>When zoomed out (< zoom level 13), pixels of gain are shaded according to the density of gain at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover gain, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover gain. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 13).</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>This data set measures areas of tree cover gain across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at 30 × 30 meter resolution, displayed as a 12-year cumulative layer. The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a> sensor. Over 600,000 Landsat 7 images were compiled and analyzed using Google Earth Engine, a cloud platform for earth observation and data analysis. The clear land surface observations (30 × 30 meter pixels) in the satellite images were assembled and a supervised learning algorithm was then applied to identify per pixel tree cover gain.</p>



          <p>Tree cover gain was defined as the establishment of tree canopy at the Landsat pixel scale in an area that previously had no tree cover. Tree cover gain may indicate a number of potential activities, including natural forest growth or the crop rotation cycle of tree plantations. </p>

              <p>The GFW team has clipped out some data in regions where data quality is suspected to be low because of persistent cloud cover over identified ecoregions. This covers parts of Liberia, Venezuela, Guyana, Vietnam, Laos, and Burma/Myanmar. The current extent of the FORMA alerts is available for viewing here—<a href='http://wri-01.cartodb.com/viz/3cc0f4c2-56d3-11e3-80bb-c8600054c0d1/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=false&cartodb_logo=false&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=3&center_lat=-1.845383988573187&center_lon=16.34765625' target='_blank'>FORMA geographic extent</a>.</p>

              <p>The algorithm behind the FORMA alerts is constantly evolving to fix bugs and improve accuracy. As a result, what appears on the site and the results of analyses conducted on the site may change over time. It is important to always include the access date when citing FORMA. Analysis of FORMA alerts on the map should be considered definitive, as analysis is based on raw FORMA data, whereas the data on the map are optimized for visual display.

              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as areas with greater than 25% canopy cover (as determined by the <a href='http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1087-3562(2003)007%3C0001%3AGPTCAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2' target='_blank'>Vegetation Continuous Fields data set</a>), and change was measured without regard to forest land use. Tree cover assemblages that meet the 25% threshold include intact forests, plantations, and forest regrowth.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>FORMA is a near real-time tree cover loss alert system. It uses a cloud computing algorithm to analyze frequently updated satellite imagery along with complementary information on factors that affect tree cover loss, such as fires and precipitation. The system generates twice-monthly “alerts” for the world’s <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf" target="_blank">humid tropical forests</a> that identify 500 × 500 meter areas where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred.</p>

          <p>FORMA is designed for quick identification of new areas of tree cover loss. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>, a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to indicate forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.</p>

          <p>FORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of tree cover loss is greater than or equal to 50%.</p>

          <p>Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 × 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the global scale.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Methodology</h3>
          <p>This data set uses freely available satellite imagery, collected by the <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a>, which operates on NASA's Terra and Aqua (EOS PM) satellite platforms and views the entire Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. The images help to reveal notable changes in vegetation cover over time using an indicator that measures vegetation intensity called the <a href='http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php' target='_blank'>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>. By applying an automated algorithm to this input and in combination with complementary data inputs for fire hotspots and global precipitation averages, areas where tree cover loss is likely to have occurred are therefore identified. The algorithm also employs parallel processing in a remote server system the cloud that enables the rapid analysis of these very large data sets.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Explanation</h3>
          <p>Tree cover loss alerts appear when and where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred after 2005. Thus the alerts should not be interpreted as an analysis of total tree cover loss area but rather as an indication of an area that has a high probability of having experienced tree cover loss or disturbance over time. The system employs advanced statistical techniques to achieve the best fit to scientifically validate information on loss, measured as a probability. On the GFW website, alerts appear only for areas where there is a 50% or higher probability of tree cover loss. That is, alerts appear for a particular period when there has been significant loss in the area during or before that period.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Temporal and spatial resolution</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are displayed on the GFW site as monthly data, and the site is updated each month. Users who download data for analysis will find that the underlying data set is actually available at 16-day intervals, intervals that do not line up perfectly with calendar months. Data is displayed at a monthly resolution on GFW due to the monthly availability of precipitation data input. Users can manipulate the GFW time slider to view trends in loss alerts from December 2005 to present.</p>

          <p>The alert system currently identifies 500 × 500 meter areas where loss is statistically likely to have occurred. Alerts for a 250-meter resolution version are currently being developed on Google’s Earth Engine platform and will be available in 2014.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Geographic extent</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are currently available only for humid tropical forests (as defined by <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.full#ref-1' target='_blank'>Hansen et al. (2008)</a>, based on <a href='http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf' target='_blank'>WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>) spanning portions of 89 countries. The development team is working to incorporate additional data to extend the geographic coverage beyond the current extent. To visualize the geographic extent of the alerts on the map, switch on the “Humid Tropical Forest Biome” layer.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Data applications</h3>
          <p>The alerts have been designed for quick identification of tree cover loss as it happens. This allows for rapid response and prioritization of scarce financial and human resources dedicated to forest conservation or sustainable forest management. Armed with this information, stakeholders can use preemptive methods such as on-the-ground visits or aerial inspection with high-resolution satellite imagery (less than 5-meter pixel resolution) to investigate suspected tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>In addition, the alerts may be of value to a variety of researchers who study both temporal and spatial patterns related to tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>Using the GFW platform, the alerts can be compared against other relevant data layers, such as protected areas and concessions boundaries, to evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices across time and spatial extent.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Accuracy and validation</h3>
          <p>Inaccuracies are an inherent part of remote sensing analysis. FORMA alerts appear in areas with a greater than 50% probability of tree cover loss, based on the algorithm described under Methodology. However, persistent cloud cover is a continuous issue in the tropics, and extreme flooding can also produce unreliable remotely sensed data that will result in tree cover loss “false positives” (alerts where no actual tree cover loss has occurred). Furthermore, the alerting system cannot detect all forest cover loss, whether due to the small size of the loss area, persistent cloud cover, or other explanations still being identified through GFW validation efforts.</p>

          <p>The major instances of false positives may occur as the following:</p>

          <ol class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>A random, "speckled" distribution of alerts across an ecoregion, or complete filling of a small ecoregion.</strong> Caused by limited or sparse training data, particularly in small ecoregions, which makes it difficult to tune the model there. As a result, alerts cannot be reliably detected. In a normal ecoregion, alerts are usually clustered.</li>

            <li><strong>A rapid explosion of alerts over 1-3 months covering a relatively large area.</strong> Caused by a significant, persistent drop in detected vegetation levels due to persistent cloud cover along coastlines, in mountains, or elsewhere.</li>

            <li><strong>Alerts in water.</strong> Caused by shifting water bodies. These alerts should be considered not necessarily as false positives but rather as ambiguous alerts requiring additional data for corroboration.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The GFW team is working aggressively to address potential inaccuracies in the data through rigorous validation methods. Specifically, the GFW team is comparing the growing data set of historical alerts to other validated data sets, which are being used for similar applications.</p>

          <p><a href='http://www.wri.org/publication/satellite-based-forest-clearing-detection-brazilian-amazon' target='_blank'>This issue brief</a> demonstrates the spatial correlation of the alerts with the PRODES and DETER data sets, produced by the Brazilian Space Agency for the Amazon. The conclusions from the working paper help to illustrate the potential pitfalls of the algorithm, along with its strengths. Through future refinement and proposed crowdsourcing efforts, the GFW team expects the data quality of the FORMA Alerts will continue to improve.</p>

          <p>The Deforestation Alert System (Sistema de Alerta de Desmatamento—SAD) is a monthly alert that monitors forest cover loss and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon. The system generates information that is published monthly by <a href='http://www.imazon.org.br/' target='_blank'>Imazon</a>, a Brazilian NGO, through its <em>Forest Transparency Bulletin</em>. The monthly alerts are derived from a temporal mosaic of <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>MODIS</a> daily images that are scaled down from 500 × 500 meter to 250 × 250 meter resolution.

          <p>The <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/latest.html' target='_blank'>Quarterly Indicator of Cover Change (QUICC)</a> product was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center by the <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/' target='_blank'>CASA</a> ecosystem modeling team. QUICC compares the MODIS global vegetation index (VI) images at the exact same time period each year on a quarterly basis (end of March, June, September, and December) and identifies land areas that have lost at least 40% of their green vegetation from the previous product and over the past year. This level of green vegetation loss is commonly associated with major forest or tree cover loss.</p>

          <p>The CASA team updates the global QUICC products as soon as the newest quarterly MODIS worldwide VI image is produced. After September (Q3) 2012, the data were adjusted to exclude forest areas located >37 degrees north as a result of confusion caused by year-to-year variations in seasonal snow cover.</p>

              <p>Not all fires are detected. There are several reasons why MODIS may not have detected a certain fire. The fire may have started and ended between satellite overpasses. The fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected in the (approximately) 1 km<sup>2</sup> pixel. Cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire.</p>
              <p>It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues.</p>

          <p>Terra-i is a near real-time monitoring system that detects land cover changes in Latin America. It uses satellite data from MODIS vegetation indices (MOD13Q1 and NDVI) and products related to presence of water bodies (MOD35) as well as Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation data to detect anthropogenic changes in vegetation cover every 16 days. Terra-i is a collaboration between the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT - DAPA), CGIAR’s Research Program on Forestry, Trees and Agroforestry (FTA), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HEIG-VD), and King’s College London (KCL).</p>

          <p>The system, which uses a computational algorithm similar to FORMA (<a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/sources/forest_change#forma">http://www.globalforestwatch.org/sources/forest_change#forma</a>), is based on the premise that natural vegetation follows a predictable pattern of change in greenness from one date to the next, brought about by site-specific land and climatic conditions over the same period. The model is trained to understand the normal pattern of changes in vegetation greenness in relation to terrain and rainfall for a site, which allows for prediction of what the next vegetation response should be based on the historical data. If the prediction is significantly different from the historical responses in relation to pattern of rainfall and lasts for two 16-day periods in a row, the pixel is marked as potentially having changed by anthropogenic means.</p>

            <dd>The forest above and below ground biomass were produced at 1 × 1 kilometer (100 ha) spatial resolution. The values for each pixel (1 × 1 km) refer to the biomass of forests remaining within the pixel and can be used directly to estimate total carbon stock in forests within one pixel. Along with the biomass values, there is an error map at the same spatial resolution providing the uncertainty in biomass estimation. It is recommended that both biomass and uncertainty values be used together for carbon assessments and verifications. The map will provide accurate estimates of total carbon stock and carbon density when aggregated to large areas (5,000-10,000 ha) for project and regional level assessments. The biomass value of a single pixel may have large uncertainty when compared with small plots for verification.</dd>

          <p>The Tropical Forest Carbon Stocks data layer shows a “benchmark” map of biomass carbon stocks for more than 2.5 billion hectares of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s. Researchers from NASA’s <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a> and <a href='http://www.winrock.org/' target='_blank'>Winrock International</a> developed the layer by collecting data from more than 4,000 in situ inventory plots, plus optical and microwave imagery (1 km resolution) to extrapolate the amount of calculated carbon stocks from forests distributed over the South American, Southeast Asia, and the sub-Saharan African regions. Further data on tree height and landscape characteristics across the tropics were derived using satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) data from the <a href='http://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/glas.php' target='_blank'>ICESAT GLAS Lidar</a>. This data set also helps illustrate regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.</p>

          <p>The <a href='http://intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable, the latter to allow for repeated assessments over time as well for verification. IFL areas were defined as unfragmented landscapes, at least 50,000 hectares in size, and with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. These were then mapped and identified from Landsat satellite imagery for the year 2013.</p>

          <p>Changes in the extent of IFLs were identified by contrasting the map for 2013 with the analogous map for 2000, adjusted for consistency. Areas identified as “reduction in extent” met the IFL criteria in 2000, but no longer met the criteria in 2013. The main causes of change were industrial activity such as logging and mining, and fragmentation due to infrastructure and new roads, and fires assumed to be caused by humans.</p>

          <p>This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. More information about the dataset and methodology is available on <a href="http://www.intactforests.org">www.intactforests.org</a></p>

          <p>This data set indicates the location of intact and degraded primary forests across Indonesia as of the year 2000. Primary forest consist of mature natural forest cover that has not been completely cleared in recent history (30 years or more) and consisted of a contiguous block of 5 ha or more. Primary forest cover was mapped using Landsat composites and multi-temporal metrics as input data to a two-step supervised classification. The first step was a per-pixel classification of areas with tree canopy cover of 30% and above for the 2000 reference year.</p>
          <p>A second per-pixel classification procedure was performed to separate primary forest from other tree cover for 2000; contiguous areas of 5 ha and greater were retained as primary forest. A limited editing of this classification was performed to remove older plantations and adjust other forest formations that could not be identified using the per-pixel classifier, but could be identified in photo-interpretive contexts. Primary forests were subsequently characterized into primary intact and primary degraded subclasses using the GIS-based buffering approach of the Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL). To create the IFL layer, buffers of roads, settlements and other signs of human landscape alteration were used to identify degraded areas within zones of primary forest cover. IFL mapping employed cloud-free Landsat mosaics to quantify changes in primary intact forest extent. The map of primary intact and primary degraded forest cover types corresponds to the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry’s primary and secondary forest cover types.</p>

          <p>The National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011) is the most recent national data product created by the United States Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC is a <a href="http://www.mrlc.gov/about.php">group of federal agencies</a> who coordinate and generate consistent and relevant land cover information at the national scale for a wide variety of environmental, land management, and modeling applications. NLCD 2011 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2011. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2011 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2011 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2011 Landsat satellite data.</p>
          <p>The 2011 land cover layer is one of five primary data products produced as part of the NLCD 2011: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover.</p>
          <p>Land cover class categories include forest, planted/cultivated lands, wetland, grassland, water, developed areas and barren land. Land cover information is critical for local, state, and federal managers and officials to assist them with issues such as assessing ecosystem status and health, modeling nutrient and pesticide runoff, understanding spatial patterns of biodiversity, land use planning, deriving landscape pattern metrics, and developing land management policies.</p>

          <p>To improve scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world ihe status and distribution of global mangroves were mapped using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive.The project interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map ‘true mangroves’.</p>
          <p>The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75% of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5° S latitude.</p>
          <p>The remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought; the estimate provided in this study is 12.3% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This data set presents the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created</p>

          <p>“Logging concession” refers to an area allocated by a government for logging in a public forest. Logging concessions are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where plantation forests are established for the production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes "forest permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms.</p>

          <p>The logging concession data on GFW, while displayed as a single layer, is assembled on a country-by-country basis from multiple sources.</p>

          <p>Logging concession data displayed on the GFW website vary from country to country by date and data sources. Data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations.<span class='hidden'> See the <%= link_to 'Data page', "#{sources_path}#forest_use" %> for details on specific data sets.</span></p>

              <p>This data set provides the boundaries of forest areas licensed to companies for forestry and is a compilation of provincial forest tenure data sets across Canada. Tenures for Nova Scotia are not provided, due to changes underway in forest management in that province, and will be added to this data set when available. Much of Canada’s logging activity occurs on Crown (often referred to as “public”) land and is regulated by various provincial commercial forest tenure systems that allocate cutting rights to and confer obligations on recipients of the tenures. It is these tenure systems on Crown forest land that are the focus of this data product. The information in this data set was gathered in order to continue to develop an understanding of how much of Canada’s forest area is under commercial forest tenures, where these tenures (including the operating areas of major forest companies) are located, and who is most likely to control them. This information and these data sets are important because of the extent of tenures and the resulting logging activity over vast areas of Canada’s Crown forest land.</p>

              <p>The Liberia logging concessions data set combines the boundaries of forest management contracts, timber sale contracts, and private use permits, compiled by Global Witness from available government and contractual maps. Due to a lack of quality data, this data set should be used for demonstration purposes only and not for land use planning purposes. Forests in Liberia are managed by the state under the National Forestry Reform Law, enacted in October 2006. Following the enactment of this law, UN Security Council timber export sanctions against Liberia were lifted, permitting commercial forestry activities to resume. Forest management contracts include concession areas of 50,000 hectares to 400,000 hectares and are open for bids from qualified bidders that demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens; concessions of more than 100,000 hectares are open for bidding from international investors. Timber sale contracts are established through a bidding process for areas up to 5,000 hectares; bidders must demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens. Private Use Permits are licenses issued to private landowners to extract wood and lack sustainability regulations. Global Witness compiled the logging concession data as part of the report <em>Signing Their Lives Away: Liberia’s Private Use Permits and the Destruction of Community Owned Rainforest</em> (Global Witness, 2012).</p>

          <p>The Liberia logging concessions data set combines the boundaries of forest management contracts, timber sale contracts, and private use permits, compiled by Global Witness from available government and contractual maps.</p>
          <p>Due to a lack of quality data, this data set should be used for demonstration purposes only and not for land use planning purposes. Forests in Liberia are managed by the state under the National Forestry Reform Law, enacted in October 2006. Following the enactment of this law, UN Security Council timber export sanctions against Liberia were lifted, permitting commercial forestry activities to resume. Forest management contracts include concession areas of 50,000 hectares to 400,000 hectares and are open for bids from qualified bidders that demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens; concessions of more than 100,000 hectares are open for bidding from international investors.</p>
          <p>Timber sale contracts are established through a bidding process for areas up to 5,000 hectares; bidders must demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens. Private Use Permits are licenses issued to private landowners to extract wood and lack sustainability regulations. Global Witness compiled the logging concession data as part of the report Signing Their Lives Away: Liberia’s Private Use Permits and the Destruction of Community Owned Rainforest (Global Witness, 2012).</p>

              <p>This data layer shows the boundaries of agro-industrial zones, where oil palm and rubber tree plantations, as well as other crops, may be established. In Cameroon, industrial agriculture falls outside of the National Forest Estate. Agricultural plantations are allocated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning to private entities under long-term, renewable contracts, which are then monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The agro-industrial data set was mapped using satellite imagery, with ground-truthing to determine the crop type and operating company. Official documentation was often lacking, so boundaries should be considered approximate and nonexhaustive.</p>

          <h3>RESUMEN</h3>
          <p>Muestra las concesiones forestales otorgadas por la autoridad forestal y supervisadas por el Organismo de Supervisión de los Recursos Forestales y de Fauna Silvestre (OSINFOR) para productos maderables, productos forestales no maderables, conservación, ecoturismo, fauna silvestre, forestación, y reforestación. La concesión otorga al concesionario el derecho exclusivo de aprovechamiento sostenible del recurso natural concedido, de acuerdo con las condiciones y limitaciones establecidas en el título de concesión. La concesión otorga a su titular el derecho de uso y explotación del recurso natural concedido y, en consecuencia, la propiedad de los frutos y productos a extraerse.</p>
          <p>El tipo de concesión se indica en los datos de atributos de cada polígono, e incluye:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><strong>Concesiones Forestales con fines Maderables</strong> - Áreas otorgadas para la extracción maderera en bosques de producción permanente establecidos en bosques primarios o secundarios.  Los títulos otorgados en dos categorías van de 5,000 hasta 10,000 hectáreas, o áreas de más de 10,000 hectáreas hasta 40,000 hectáreas; para ambas categorías el plazo es de hasta cuarenta años y puede renovarse.</li>
            <li><strong>Concesiones para Productos Forestales no Maderables</strong> - ASon  concesiones cuyo objetivo es contribuir de manera directa a la conservación de especies de flora y fauna silvestre  a través de la protección efectiva y usos compatibles como la investigación, educación, y la restauración  ecológica.

          <p>The <a href="http://www.v-c-s.org">State of the World's Rivers</a> is an interactive web database that illustrates data on ecological health in the world’s 50 major river basins. Indicators of ecosystem health are grouped into the categories of river fragmentation, biodiversity, and water quality. The database was created and published by International Rivers in 2014.</p>
          <p>The Dam Hotspots data contains over 5,000 dam locations determined by latitude and longitude coordinates. These locations were confined to the world’s 50 major river basins. The data set comes from multiple sources, and was corrected for location errors by International Rivers. The “project status”—a moving target—was determined by acquiring official government data, as well as through primary research from Berkeley and five International Rivers’ regional offices.</p>

          <p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via <a href='http://www.protectedplanet.net/' target='_blank'>protectedplanet.net</a>, the online interface for the <a href='http://www.wdpa.org/' target='_blank'>World Database on Protected Areas</a> (WDPA). The WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.</p>

          <p><strong><a href='http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/' target='_blank'>IUCN Management Categories</a></strong></p>

          <p>Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the  <a href='http://www.iucn.org/' target='_blank'>International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.</p>

          <p>As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the “legal designation” and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>Ia. Strict Nature Reserves.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. <em>Other common designations:</em> Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</li>
            <li><strong>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</strong> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</li>
            <li><strong>II. National Parks.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. <em>Other common designations:</em> State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</li>
            <li><strong>III. National Monuments or Features.</strong> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. <em>Other common designations:</em> Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</li>
            <li><strong>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</strong> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</li>
            <li><strong>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</strong> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</li>
            <li><strong>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</strong> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>First defined in 1988 by scientist Norman Myers, biodiversity hotspots are areas characterized by high levels of endemic plants coupled with significant habitat loss. Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification:</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li>At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic</li>
            <li>At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35.</p>

          <p>Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) is a data set of the geographic distribution Earth's terrestrial biodiversity. Ecoregions are defined as relatively large units of land or water containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities sharing a large majority of species, environmental conditions, and processes, such as migrations or fire disturbance regimes. The 867 terrestrial ecoregions are classified into 14 different biomes, such as forests, grasslands, or deserts. Ecoregions represent the original distribution of distinct assemblages of species and communities.</p>
          <p>The TEOW data set provides:</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li>A map of terrestrial biodiversity that gives enough detail to be useful in global and regional conservation priority-setting and planning efforts</li>

          <p>While many bird species are widespread, over 2,500 are endemic and restricted to an area smaller than 5 million hectares (restricted-range species). BirdLife International has mapped every restricted-range species using geo-referenced locality records. Through this process, they identified regions of the world—known as “Endemic Bird Areas” (EBAs)—where the distributions of two or more of these species overlap.</p>

          <p>Half of all restricted-range species are globally threatened or near-threatened, and the other half remain vulnerable to loss or degradation of habitat. The majority of EBAs are also important for the conservation of restricted-range species from other animal and plant groups. The unique landscapes where these bird species occur, amounting to just 4.5% of the earth's land surface, are high priorities for broad-scale ecosystem conservation.</p>

          <p>Geographically, EBAs are often islands or mountain ranges, and vary considerably in size, from a few hundred hectares to more than 10,000,000 hectares. EBAs also vary in the number of restricted-range species that they support (from two to 80). EBAs are found around the world, but most (77%) of them are located in the tropics and subtropics.</p>

          <p>Created by the <a href="http://www.zeroextinction.org/">Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE)</a>, this data set shows 587 sites for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. The species found within these sites have extremely small global ranges and populations; any change to habitat within a site may lead to the extinction of a species in the wild. To meet AZE Extinction Site status, a site must:</p>
          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li>Contain at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species</li>
            <li>Be the sole area where an Endangered or Critically Endangered species occurs</li>
            <li>Contain greater than 95% of either the known resident population of the species or 95% of the known population of one life history segment (e.g. breeding or wintering) of the species</li>
            <li>Have a definable boundary (e.g., species range, extent of contiguous habitat, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Launched in 2005, the Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) engages 83 non-governmental biodiversity conservation organizations working to prevent species extinctions. The AZE identifies and safeguards places where species evaluated to be Endangered or Critically Endangered by the <a href="http://www.iucn.org">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> are restricted to single remaining sites.</p>

          <p>Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs) are large blocks of contiguous or connected area of suitable tiger habitat that that can support at least five adult tigers and where tiger presence has been confirmed in the past 10 years. The data set was created by mapping tiger distribution, determined by land cover type, forest extent, and prey base, against a human influence index. Areas of high human influence that overlapped with suitable habitat were not considered tiger habitat.</p><p>Tigers require a large area to survive. Accordingly, habitat loss is a major cause of the species’ rapid decline. Before this data set, many countries containing tigers did not have spatially explicit tiger habitat maps necessary to develop habitat conservation and management plans. Among others, this information gap was an impetus to developing the TCL data set.</p>

          <p>This data set displays 29 Tx2 Tiger Conservation Landscapes (Tx2 TCLs), defined areas that could double the wild tiger population through proper conservation and management by 2020.</p>
          <p>The number of wild tigers has declined from an estimated 100,000 in the early 1900s to a current estimate of around 3,500 adult animals. In response to this rapid decline, government officials convened in November 2010 to endorse the St. Petersburg Declaration, pledging to double the wild tiger population by 2020. To aid in this effort, Wikramanayake and his team conducted a landscape analysis of tiger habitat to determine if a recovery of such magnitude is possible. They identified 29 Tiger Conservation Landscapes with potential for doubling wild tiger population with proper conservation and management.</p>

Corridors are defined as existing forests connecting current Royal Bengal tiger meta-populations in Nepal and India.</p>
          <p>The TAL is spread over 4.95 million hectares, linking 14 transboundary protected areas across Nepal and India. This landscape has the second largest population of rhinos, one of the highest densities of tiger populations, and is home to the Asiatic elephant. In Nepal, TAL encompasses 2.31 million hectares extending over 14 districts and includes 75 percent of the remaining forests of lowland Nepal.  In addition, TAL was recognized as a WWF Global 200 ecoregion and spans three Ramsar sites and two World Heritage Sites.</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.v-c-s.org">Verified Carbon Standard</a> (VCS) is the world’s most widely used voluntary greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction program. VCS projects are developed across a wide range of sectoral scopes, including those classified within the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. These projects reduce emissions from forest-related activities around the world and apply innovative GHG accounting methodologies to quantify such emission reductions, which are independently verified and transparently registered.</p>
          <p>This layer shows VCS projects categorized as REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), IFM (Improved Forest Management) and ARR (Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation).  More detail on the VCS program and these project categories can be found in the <a href="http://www.v-c-s.org/program-documents">VCS Standard and VCS AFOLU Requirements</a> documents.</p>
          <p>In addition to these project activities, more than a dozen national and subnational jurisdictions around the world are applying the <a href="http://www.v-c-s.org/JNR">VCS Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+</a> framework to account for the emission reductions generated by their REDD+ policies and measures. This information will be added in the future as these programs register under the VCS.</p>

          <p>A conservation easement, according to the Land Trust Alliance, is “a legal agreement between a landowner and a land trust or government agency that permanently limits uses of the land in order to protect its conservation values.” The National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) is the first national database of conservation agencies throughout the United States. Voluntary and secure, the NCED respects landowner privacy and will not collect landowner names or sensitive information. This public-private partnership brings together national conservation groups, local and regional land trusts, and state and federal agencies around a common objective. The NCED provides a comprehensive picture of the estimated 40 million acres of privately owned conservation easement lands, recognizing their contribution to America’s natural heritage, a vibrant economy, and healthy communities.</p>

          <p>Before the NCED was created no single, nationwide system existed for sharing and managing information about conservation easements. By building the first national database and web site to access this information, the NCED helps agencies, land trusts, and other organizations plan more strategically, identify opportunities for collaboration, advance public accountability, and raise the profile of what's happening on-the-ground in the name of conservation.</p>

          <p>With the initial support of the <a href="http://www.usendowment.org/">U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities</a>, NCED is the result of a collaboration between five environmental non-profits: <a href="http://www.landscope.org/connect/find/partners/tpl/">The Trust for Public Land</a>, <a href="http://www.ducks.org/">Ducks Unlimited</a>, <a href="http://www.landscope.org/connect/find/partners/defenders/">Defenders of Wildlife</a>, <a href="http://www.landscope.org/connect/find/partners/cbi/"> Conservation Biology Institute</a>, and <a href="http://www.natureserve.org/">NatureServe.</a></p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>Data compiled under “People” indicate areas over which indigenous peoples or local communities have rights over land and/or certain resources.</p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>The laws of many countries separate land rights from resource rights. Legally recognized land rights extend to the land and certain resources associated with the land, depending on the nature of the right. The right to the land and certain resources include some combination of rights of access, use, management, exclusion, and alienation. Similarly, legally recognized resource rights can cover some combination of the right to access, use, manage, exclude, or alienate forests, wildlife, or other resources. Whether rights to the land or resources, the law may recognize their rights in perpetuity or for a limited period of time. </p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>Some data sets displayed on Global Forest Watch include land and resource rights governed by customary tenure systems but that are not recognized by national laws.</p>

              <p>A Reserve legally recognizes a tribal group’s perpetual right of access, use, withdrawal, management, and exclusion over land and its associated resources. The land remains officially owned by the British Crown and administered by either the Canadian Federal or Provincial Governments. Alienation of Reserve land is prohibited, except to the British Crown. Reserve land may be allocated to individual members of the tribe by a tribal Council in the form of Certificates of Possession with the approval of the Minister of Indian Affairs. Certificates of Possession entitle a member of the tribe to beneficial use and enjoyment of a specific area in the Reserve, as well as the right to transfer the land through sale, lease, will, or otherwise to other members of the tribe subject to the approval of the Minister of Indian Affairs.</p>

              <p>Native Title is generally the legal recognition of the rights of indigenous groups to land and resources. The specific rights vary depending on whether the area is subject to competing legal rights, such as private ownership or leases, as well as the customary rights exercised over the area. Native title could grant rights of access, use, withdrawal for subsistence, and, in some cases, rights of management and exclusion.</p>

          <p>The inalienable Aboriginal Freehold Lands dataset represents boundary and attribute information for land parcels, granted to incorporated Aboriginal groups through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976, which are greater than 40 hectares. Aboriginal Land is private property owned under special Freehold title. It is inalienable, meaning it cannot be bought, acquired, or forfeited. The inalienable Aboriginal Freehold is granted as a communal title (where land is held collectively by a group, rather than by individuals), and is the strongest form of title in Australia. This title gives Aboriginal groups the power to control the direction and pace of development on their land. The dataset only includes Aboriginal Lands that are officially registered.

Although the Government retains ownership of subsoil resources, the indigenous community must be consulted by government and private organizations for proposed developments on their lands. The government and mining concessionaire are required to guarantee benefits to the community and compliance with sustainable development practices.</p>

          <p>This data set displays the boundaries of areas designated as Indigenous Lands in Brazil. Indigenous Lands legally recognize indigenous peoples’ perpetual rights of access, use, withdrawal, management, and exclusion over the land and associated resources. Alienation of the land is prohibited. However, commercial use of forest resources is permitted, but cutting trees for sale requires approval by the National Legislature. Rights to subsoil resources may be obtained only with the approval of the National Legislature and after consultation with the affected indigenous peoples. This data set includes Indigenous Lands that are officially registered and those at various stages of the registration process.</p>

          <p>A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing more than 1,000,000 national and sub-national geographic units, is used to assign population values to grid cells.

Its spatial resolution is 0.6 miles (1 km) and was validated against data from a network of nearly 70 ground sites around the world. It was developed by a team of scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California; the University of Maryland, College Park; and Woods Hole Research Center, Falmouth, Massachusetts. The map was created using 2.5 million carefully screened, globally distributed laser pulse measurements from space. The light detection and ranging (Lidar) data were collected in 2005 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System instrument on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat).</p>

  <h2 class='source_category_title'>Countries</h2>
  <div class='single-source-item'>
    <p>Data provided on the <%= link_to 'country pages', countries_path %> come from a range of sources. Read below to learn more about each.</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</h3>
    <p>Many figures on the country pages come from the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). As stated on the <a href='http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/' target='_blank'>FAO website</a>, the FRA is a comprehensive assessment of forests and forestry that examines the current status and recent trends for different variables covering the extent, condition, uses and values of forests. To create the report, information was collated from 233 countries and territories for four points in time: 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. FAO worked closely with countries and specialists in the design and implementation of FRA 2010 - through regular contact, expert consultations, training for national correspondents and ten regional and subregional workshops. More than 900 contributors were involved, including 178 officially nominated national correspondents and their teams. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/' target='_blank'>FAO website</a> or <a href='http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i3110e/i3110e.pdf' target='_blank'>download the full report</a>.</p>

    <p>The country pages also present data from <a href='http://faostat.fao.org/' target='_blank'>FAOSTAT</a>, FAO’s platform for data collection and dissemination. According to FAO, the FAOSTAT <a href='http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/G2/*/E' target='_blank'>Emissions Land Use database</a> provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. Changes in carbon stocks and ecosystem function linked to anthropogenic activities such as land-use change and land management determine emissions and removals of GHG that are reported by countries for the IPCC Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://faostat.fao.org/' target='_blank'>FAOSTAT website</a>.</p>

    <p>Data on the economic value and employment in national forestry sectors are reported from “Contribution of the forestry sector to national economies, 1990-2006” by A. Lebedys. Forest Finance Working Paper FSFM/ACC/08. FAO, Rome. To learn more, <a href='ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/k4588e/k4588e00.pdf' target='_blank'>download the full report</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Figures:</strong> type of forest, economic value of the forestry sector, employment, carbon stocks, emissions</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>University of Maryland (UMD)/Google</h3>
    <p>Figures for tree cover, loss, and gain presented on the country and global overview pages were calculated using tabular data from a 2013 publication, “<a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850' target='_blank'>High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change</a>" by Hansen <em>et al</em>.</p>

    <p><strong>Figures:</strong> UMD/Google circle graphs, 2012 tree cover, all global overview graphs and rankings</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>European Space Agency (GlobCover)</h3>
    <p>Data from the European Space Agency’s GlobCover was used to visualize tree cover on the country pages. As stated on the <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/' target='_blank'>ESA website</a>, GlobCover is an initiative which began in 2005 in partnership with a number of organizations. The aim of the project was to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using input observations from the 300m MERIS sensor on board the ENVISAT satellite mission. ESA makes available the land cover maps, which cover 2 periods: December 2004 - June 2006 and January - December 2009. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/' target='_blank'>GlobCover website</a> or <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/LandCover2009/Globcover2009_V2.3_Global_.zip' target='_blank'>download the 2009 GlobCover map</a>.</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>The Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI)</h3>
    <p>Figures on forest tenure come from the Rights and Resource Initiative and are based on data adapted from the <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/documents/index.php?pubID=1075' target='_blank'>Tropical Forest Tenure Assessment</a>. The goal of the report is to present and analyze the state of forest tenure in much of the world’s tropical forests. As stated on <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/programs.php?id=237' target='_blank'>RRI's website</a>, the tenure systems represented by this data is sourced from governments, and therefore only reflects those systems of natural resource management that are legally recognized by those governments. Such officially outlined tenure systems fall under the category of statutory tenure regimes within these studies. The official data often presents an incomplete picture of the institutions that actually manage natural resources, particularly at a local level. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/programs.php?id=237' target='_blank'>RRI forest tenure page</a>.</p>
