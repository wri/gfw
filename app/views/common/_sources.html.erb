                  <p>Forest > 25% includes all types of forest be it plantations, primary forest, secondary forest or any other type of cover that has trees. Hence tree cover change does not equate deforestation. The change could be the result of harvesting of timber in plantations or replanting of palm oil trees.</p>

                  <p>In some cases tree cover loss between 2000 and 2012 appears in areas where there was no tree cover in 2000 according to the tree cover extent map. This is because Landsat did not register tree cover in areas that had very low tree cover density (e.g. <5%) in 2000, but the process used to detect tree cover loss between 2000 and 2012 was capable of detecting drops in tree cover at even the lowest densities (e.g. 0-5%). In these instances it appears as though tree cover loss occurred in areas without tree cover in the year 2000, when in fact there was tree cover in these areas, just at very low densities that were not detected by Landsat.</p>

              <p>This data set measures both area of tree cover loss and gain across the globe at 30 × 30 meter spatial resolution on an annual basis from 2001 to 2012.  However gain is only displayed as a 12 year cumulative layer.  The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php" target="_blank">Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a> sensor. Multiple Landsat 7 images were compiled in Google Earth Engine and the clear surface observations from these images were then assembled into a per pixel forest probability time series that was classified into either tree cover loss or no change. Tree cover loss was defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale.  Forest gain was defined as the inverse of loss, or the establishment of tree canopy from non-forest state.  Both global forest loss and gain were related to tree cover density for climate domains, ecozones, and countries. Previously tested methods of high- (Quickbird) and medium- (Landsat) resolution satellite imagery interpretation for tree cover were used to delineate change and no change for training data and to determine the areas of tree cover loss and gain.</p>

              <p>The FORMA alerts data set uses an <a href="https://github.com/reddmetrics/forma-clj" target="_blank">algorithm</a> to analyze freely available satellite imagery products and other ancillary data to identify new areas of forest clearing in near real-time across the world’s <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf" target="_blank">humid tropical forest biome</a>. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>, a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to be indicative of forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.</p>

              <p>This algorithm produces alerts that indicate where forest clearing is statistically likely to have occurred within a 500 meter × 500 meter area. FORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of forest clearing is greater than or equal to 50.</p>

              <p>Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 meters × 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the global scale.</p>

              <h3>Methodology</h3>
              <p>This dataset uses freely available satellite imagery, collected by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a>, which operates on NASA's Terra and Aqua (EOS PM) satellite platforms and views the entire Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. The images help to reveal notable changes in vegetation cover over time using an indicator that measures vegetation intensity called the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>. By applying an automated algorithm to this input and in combination with complementary data inputs for fire hotspots and global precipitation averages, areas where forest clearing is likely to have occurred are therefore identified. The algorithm also employs parallel processing in a remote server system the cloud that enables the rapid analysis of these very large data sets.</p>

              <h3>Explanation</h3>
              <p>Forest clearing alerts appear when and where new, large-scale clearing is likely to have occurred after 2005. Thus, the alerts should not be interpreted as an analysis of total forest cover loss area, but rather as an indication of an area that has a high probability of having experienced forest cover loss or disturbance over time. The system employs advanced statistical techniques to achieve the best fit to scientifically validate information on clearing, measured as a probability. On the GFW website, alerts appear only for 50 percent or higher probability. That is, alerts appear for a particular period when there has been significant clearing in the area during or before that period.</p>

              <h3>Temporal and spatial resolution</h3>
              <p>FORMA alerts are displayed on the GFW site as monthly data, and the site is updated each month. Users who download data for analysis will find that the underlying dataset is actually available at 16-day intervals, intervals that do not line up perfectly with calendar months. Data is displayed at a monthly resolution on GFW due to the monthly availability of precipitation data input. Users can manipulate the GFW time slider to view trends in clearing alerts from December 2005 to present.</p>

              <p>The alert system currently identifies 500 x 500 meter areas where clearing is statistically likely to have occurred. Alerts for a 250-meter resolution version are currently being developed on Google’s Earth Engine platform and will be available in 2014.</p>

              <h3>Geographic extent</h3>
              <p>FORMA alerts are currently available only for humid tropical forests (as defined by <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.full#ref-1" target="_blank">Hansen et al. (2008)</a>, based on <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf" target="_blank">WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>) spanning portions of 89 countries. The development team is working to incorporate additional data to extend the geographic coverage beyond the current extent. Currently FORMA data spans across portions of 89 countries. To visualize the geographic extent of the alerts on the map, switch on the “Humid Tropical Forest Biome” layer.</p>

              <h3>Data applications</h3>
              <p>The forest clearing alerts have been designed for quick identification of forest clearing as it emerges. This allows for rapid response and prioritization of scarce financial and human resources dedicated to forest conservation or sustainable forest management. Armed with this information, stakeholders can use preemptive methods such as on-the-ground visits or aerial inspection with high-resolution satellite imagery (less than 5 meter pixel resolution) to investigate suspected forest clearing areas.</p>

              <p>In addition, the alerts may be of value to a variety of researchers who study both temporal and spatial patterns related to forest clearing areas.</p>

              <p>Using the GFW platform, the alerts can be compared against other relevant data layers, such as protected areas and concessions boundaries, to evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices across time and spatial extent.</p>

              <h3>Accuracy and validation</h3>
              <p>Inaccuracies are an inherent part of remote sensing analysis. FORMA Alerts appear in areas with a greater than 50% probability of deforestation, based on the algorithm described under methodology. However, persistent cloud cover is a continuous issue in the tropics, and extreme flooding can also produce unreliable remotely-sensed data that will result in forest clearing “false positives” (alerts where no actual tree cover loss has occurred). Furthermore, the alerting system cannot detect all forest cover loss, whether due to the small size of clearings, persistent cloud cover, or other explanations still being identified through GFW validation efforts.</p>

              <p>The major instances of false positives may occur as the following:</p>

              <ol class="bullets">
                <li><strong>A random, "speckled" distribution of alerts across an ecoregion, or complete filling of a small ecoregion.</strong> Caused by limited or sparse training data, particularly in small ecoregions, which makes it difficult to tune the model there. As a result, alerts cannot be reliably detected. In a normal ecoregion, alerts are usually clustered.</li>

                <li><strong>A rapid explosion of alerts over 1-3 months covering a relatively large area.</strong> Caused by a significant, persistent drop in detected vegetation levels due to persistent cloud cover along coastlines, in mountains, or elsewhere.</li>

                <li><strong>Alerts in water.</strong> Caused by shifting water bodies. These alerts should not necessarily be considered false positives, but rather ambiguous alerts requiring additional data for corroboration.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>The GFW team is working aggressively to address potential inaccuracies in the data through rigorous validation methods. Specifically, the GFW team is comparing the growing data set of historical alerts to other validated data sets, which are being used for similar applications.</p>

              <p>This paper demonstrates the spatial correlation of the alerts with the PRODES and DETER data sets, produced by the Brazilian Space Agency for the Amazon. The conclusions from the paper help to illustrate the potential pitfalls of the algorithm, along with its strengths. Through future refinement and proposed crowdsourcing efforts, the GFW team expects the data quality of the FORMA Alerts will continue to improve.</p>

              <p>The Deforestation Alert System (Sistema de Alerta de Desmatamento—SAD) is a monthly alert that monitors forest cover loss and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon. The system generates information that is published monthly by <a href="http://www.imazon.org.br/" target="_blank">Imazon</a>, a Brazilian NGO, through its <em>Forest Transparency Bulletin</em>. The monthly alerts are derived from a temporal mosaic of <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> daily images that are scaled down from 500 × 500 meter to 250 × 250 meter resolution. The monthly results are then validated using medium resolution images from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (<a href="http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/" target="_blank">CBERS</a>) and NASA <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat</a> data in order to “ground-truth” the results being reported.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/latest.html" target="_blank">Quarterly Indicator of Cover Change (QUICC)</a> product was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center by the <a href="http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/" target="_blank">CASA</a> ecosystem modeling team. QUICC compares the MODIS global vegetation index (VI) images at the exact same time period each year on a quarterly basis (end of March, June, September, and December) and identifies land areas that have lost at least 40% of their green vegetation from the previous product and over the past year. This level of green vegetation loss is commonly associated with major forest or tree cover loss.</p>

              <p>The CASA team updates the global QUICC products as soon as the newest quarterly MODIS worldwide VI image is produced. After September (Q3) 2012, the data were adjusted to exclude forest areas located >37 degrees north as a result of confusion caused by year-to-year variations in seasonal snow cover</p>

              <p>This data set shows the global percent tree cover for the year 2000 at 30 × 30 meter spatial resolution and covering all global lands except for Antarctica and a number of Arctic islands.  The extent data was generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a> sensor, and all images were compiled in the Google Earth Engine. The clear surface observations from the thousands of images employed for the analysis were then assembled into a per pixel forest probability time series to classify tree cover. For the classification threshold of tree cover, trees were defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height.</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://intactforests.org/" target="_blank">Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent, areas that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained.  To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable to allow for repeated assessments over time as well for verification.  The criteria were separated into two groups to assess the spatial extent of developed areas and the fragmentation of these areas.  These were then mapped and identified from <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat</a> satellite imagery for the year 2000. The landscapes identified as unfragmented were at least 50,000 hectares in size with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. </p>

              <p>The Tropical Forest Carbon Stocks data layer shows a “benchmark” map of biomass carbon stocks for more than 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s. Researchers from NASA’s <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and <a href="http://www.winrock.org/" target="_blank">Winrock International</a> developed the layer by collecting data from more than 4,000 in situ inventory plots, plus optical and microwave imagery (1km resolution) to extrapolate the amount of calculated carbon stocks from forests distributed over the South American, Southeast Asia, and the Sub-Saharan African regions. Further data on tree height and landscape characteristics across the tropics were derived using satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) data from the <a href="http://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/glas.php" target="_blank">ICESAT GLAS Lidar</a>. This data set also helps to illustrate regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.</p>

              <p>“Logging concession” refers to an area allocated by a government for logging in a public forest. Logging concessions are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where plantation forests are established for the production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes forest permits, tenures, licenses, and other terms.</p>

              <p>The logging concession data on GFW, while displayed as a single layer, is assembled on a country-by-country basis from multiple sources.</p>

              <p>Logging concession data displayed on the GFW website vary from country to country by date and data sources. Data may come from government agencies, NGOs, or other organizations.<span class="hidden"> See the <%= link_to "Data page", sources_path %> for details on specific data sets.</span></p>

              <h3>Cameroon forest management units</h3>

              <p>Logging in Cameroon’s forests is permitted within Forest Management Units (FMUs). This data set displays the FMUs within Cameroon’s permanent forest estate. Selective logging is permitted in Cameroon’s FMUs, which are further divided into logging concessions called annual allowable cuts (AACs).  These logging permits require owners and operators to maintain permanent forest cover. This data set was produced in collaboration between the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry an d Wildlife and WRI. For more information and data sets, see the <a href="http://www.wri.org/project/interactive-forest-atlas-cameroon" target="_blank">Interactive Forest Atlas for Cameroon</a>.</p>

              <h3>Canada forest tenures</h3>
              <strong class="download">Download coming soon</strong>
              <p>This dataset provides the boundaries of forest areas licensed to companies for forestry and is a compilation of Provincial forest tenure datasets across Canada. Tenures for Nova Scotia are not provided due to changes underway in forest management in that province, and will be added to this dataset when available. Much of Canada’s logging activity occurs on Crown (often referred to as “public”) land and is regulated by various provincial commercial forest tenure systems that allocate cutting rights to and infer obligations on recipients of the tenures. It is these tenure systems on Crown forest land that are the focus of this data product. The information in this dataset was gathered in order to continue to develop an understanding of how much of Canada’s forest area is under commercial forest tenures, where these tenures (including the operating areas of major forest companies) are located, and who is most likely to control them. This information and these datasets are important because of the extent of tenures and the resulting logging activity over vast areas of Canada’s Crown forestland.</p>

              <h3>Liberia logging concessions</h3>
              <strong class="download">Download coming soon</strong>
              <p>The Liberia logging concessions dataset combines the boundaries of forest management contracts, timber sale contracts, and private use permits, compiled by Global Witness from available government and contractual maps. Due to a lack of quality data, this dataset should be used for demonstration purposes only and not for land use planning purposes. Forests in Liberia are managed by the state under the National Forestry Reform Law, enacted in October 2006. Following the enactment of this law, UN Security Council timber export sanctions against Liberia were lifted permitting commercial forestry activities to resume. Forest management contracts include concession areas of 50,000 hectares to 400,000 hectares and are open for bids from qualified bidders that demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens; concessions over than 100,000 hectares are open for bidding from international investors. Timber sale contracts are established through a bidding process for areas up to 5,000 hectares; bidders must demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens. Private Use Permits are licenses issued to private land owners to extract wood and lack sustainability regulations. Global Witness compiled the logging concession data as part of the report, Signing Their Lives Away:  Liberia’s Private Use Permits and the Destruction of Community Owned Rainforest (Global Witness, 2012).</p>

              <h3>Cameroon agro-industrial zones</h3>
              <strong class="download"><a href="http://www.wri.org/our-work/project/congo-basin-forests/cameroon#project-tabs" target="_blank">Download at WRI.org</a></strong>
              <p>This data layer shows the boundaries of agro-industrial zones, where oil palm and rubber tree plantations, as well as other crops, may be established. In Cameroon, industrial agriculture falls outside of the National Forest Estate. Agricultural plantations are allocated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning to private entities under long-term, renewable contracts, which are then monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The agro-industrial data set was mapped using satellite imagery, with ground-truthing to determine the crop type and operating company. Official documentation was often lacking, so boundaries should be considered approximate and nonexhaustive.</p>

              <p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/" target="_blank">protectedplanet.net</a>, the online interface for the <a href="http://www.wdpa.org/" target="_blank">World Database on Protected Areas</a> (WDPA). WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.</p>
              <strong><a href="http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/" target="_blank">IUCN Management Categories</a></strong>
              <p>Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the  <a href="http://www.iucn.org/" target="_blank">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.</p>
              <p>As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the “legal designation” and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.</p>

              <ul class="bullets">
                <li><strong>Ia. Strict Nature Reserves.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. <em>Other common designations:</em> Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</li>
                <li><strong>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</strong> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</li>
                <li><strong>II. National Parks.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. <em>Other common designations:</em> State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</li>
                <li><strong>III. National Monuments or Features.</strong> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. <em>Other common designations:</em> Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</li>
                <li><strong>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</strong> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</li>
                <li><strong>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</strong> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</li>
                <li><strong>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</strong> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve</li>
              </ul>

              <p>First defined in 1988 by scientist Norman Myers, biodiversity hotspots are areas characterized by high levels of endemic plants coupled with significant habitat loss. Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic</li>
                <li>At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost</li>
              </ul>

              <p>When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35.</p>

Its spatial resolution is 0.6 miles (1 km) and was validated against data from a network of nearly 70 ground sites around the world. It was developed by a team of scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California; the University of Maryland, College Park; and Woods Hole Research Center, Falmouth, Massachusetts.  The map was created using 2.5 million carefully screened, globally distributed laser pulse measurements from space. The light detection and ranging (lidar) data were collected in 2005 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System instrument on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat).</p>
