    <p>This Privacy Policy tells you how World Resources Institute ("WRI," "we," or "us") handles information collected about you through our websites and applications (collectively, the “Services”). By using our websites or by providing information to us through the Services, you agree to the collection and use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>WRI is a global research organization that spans more than 50 countries, with offices in the United States, China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and more.

Thus, personal information may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and accessed from the United States and countries other than the country in which the information was initially collected. In all such instances, we use, transfer, and disclose personal information solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
