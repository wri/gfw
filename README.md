# What is Global Forest Watch?

[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) is a
dynamic online forest monitoring and alert system that empowers people
everywhere to better manage forests.

This repository contains the GFW web app.

# Developing

The GFW web app rides on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

## Docker

Place required environment settings in the `dev.env` file, and then run:

`./gfw.sh develop`

GFW should then be accessible at [localhost:5000/map](http://localhost:5000/map), note, it may take around 2 mins to load due to large number of requests.

## OS X Yosemite (10.10) Setup

First make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) and
[Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
installed.

Next install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the OS X package manager:

```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

We recommend managing your Ruby installation through
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). It's just an easy way to
run multiple Ruby versions for different applications:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
$ brew install imagemagick@6
```

Next clone the gfw repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw.git
```

Using rbenv, install and set Ruby 2.4.0 in the main app directory:

```bash
$ cd gfw
$ rbenv install 2.4.0
$ rbenv local 2.4.0
```

Now let's install Ruby on Rails:

```bash
$ gem install rails
```

Aaaaand now use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), a rubygem manager, to
install all the gem depenencies for the app:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Installing front end dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Almost there! Final steps are to update your `.env` file:

```bash
RACK_ENV=development
GFW_API_HOST_NEW_API=https://production-api.globalforestwatch.org/v1
GFW_API_HOST_PROD=https://production-api.globalforestwatch.org/v1
GFW_API_AUTH=https://production-api.globalforestwatch.org
GFW_API_HOST=http://api.globalforestwatch.org/
AWS_HOST=/uploads
LAYER_SPEC=layerspec
TERMS_COOKIE=true
S3_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_DATA_BUCKET_NAME=
S3_DATA_BUCKET_REGION=
ANALYTICS_PROPERTY_ID='UA-XXXXX-X'
FEEDBACK_MAIL=example@gfw.com
CACHE_VERSION=54
GFW_ASSETS_URL=http://gfw-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/gfw-assets.latest.js
HOWTO_URL=http://vizzuality.github.io/gfw-howto
DEVELOPERS_URL=http://vizzuality.github.io/gfw-atlas
BLOG_HOST=http://blog.globalforestwatch.org
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=xxx
```

Last step. For real. Start the app server and access it at
[http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000):

```bash
$ foreman start
```

If you are working on pages with react support, the command to execute would be:

```bash
$ ./bin/server
```

Oh, and you should probably launch the
[gfw-api](https://github.com/wri/gfw-api)
[dev_apperver.py](https://github.com/wri/gfw-api#developing) before you
try to visit the site on your local machine.

## Layers

Map layers, somewhat unsurprisingly, are an important part of GFW. As
such, the config and code supporting them can be a bit complex. Check
out the [layer documentation](docs/layers) for more information. If the
component you're working on isn't in there, please write some
documentation when you're done! 💞

## Google Custm Search API

Global Forest Watch uses the Google Custom Search API to power it's site-wide
search.

The search requests are handled inside: `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`
And depend on two config variables that you'll need to setup as ENV vars on
your `.env` file locally or in the Heroku environment settings.

```
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_CX
```

Currently the API being used was generated by `simao.belchior@vizzuality.com`
and the custom search context is owned by Alyssa Barrett on the Google Custom
Search Engine control panel.



## Tests

### Front-end

We have a few Javascript tests in `jstest/` which you can (read: should)
run with Grunt:

```
grunt test
```
